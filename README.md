This is a multiplayer connect four game built with socket.io.

To play:
1. Go to http://multiplayer-connect-four.herokuapp.com/ in two Chrome browser windows. (Allow for 6 second delay
on the load because I am using free Heroku hosting.)
2. Create a new game, and select that game from the dropdown menu in both windows.
3. Play until someone gets four in a row.
4. Refresh the page to play again.


Have fun!
