 *    ['blank', 'blank', 'blank', 'red', 'blank', 'blank', 'blank']
 * ]
 * You can see that each inner array is a row.  The strings in each inner array
 * represent the state of each slot in the row.  'blank' means that there has been
 * no move there and it will be drawn as white on the UI.  'red' means that the red
 * player holds this spot and it will be drawn on the UI as red.  'blue' means that
 * the blue player holds this spot and it will be drawn on the UI as blue.
